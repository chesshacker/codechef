Code Chef Practice Problems

These are some practice problems I solved while brushing up on my Python.  Each directory includes a README.txt file with the instructions that were provided.  Additionally, it includes an examples.txt file which can be used by the test tool I wrote called cctest.  To run the tests for each program, change to the program's directory and run ../cctest.py
